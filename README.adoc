= Deploying a Java EE 8 Application on Heroku

This is a simple playground-project to experiment with Java EE 8 on link:[Heroku].
The application can be either deploy on TomEE or OpenLiberty.
You can read the details link:http://dplatz.de/blog/2018/heroku.html[on my blog].

== Usage

=== Build & Deploy locally

----
$ ./run_docker.sh
----

Open http://localhost.
If port 80 is not free on your system, you will have to change the port-mapping in `run_docker.sh`.

By default, `run_docker.sh deploy to TomEE. Switch the commented out line to deploy on OpenLiberty.

=== Deploy to Heroku

----
$ heroku create
$ heroku stack:set container
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku open
----

By default, the `heroku.yml` deploy to TomEE. Reference `Docker.liberty` to change the application-server to OpenLiberty.
